**What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?**

Create a program to analyze headlines from the Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC).

**What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?**

1. I read the readme file
2. I planned out my high-level steps
3. I wrote the algorithm
4. I wrote and tested my code
5. Adjusted algorithm accordingly

**What were the Key concepts explored?**

Use of files and lists, designing and implementing functions.

**Did your results match what you expected to get?**

Yes. Although my character count is off by 1 from the test cases. I am unable to figure out why. 

**Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?**

Yes. There is error checking for all user input. 

**What challenges did you encounter?**

I had an issue with the average character count, it was giving me very off numbers.

**How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?**

1. Think before Programming: I read the read me file and completed the algorithm before starting to program.
2. Program is the embodiment of the algorithm: My code follows the algorithm
3. Improve through practice: By completing this PA, I improved my algorithm, function defining, and overall programming skills. 

**Did you overcome them, and how?**

Yes. It was a formatting issue which changed the order of operations for the calculation.

**Any key takeaways?**

Planning out the high-level steps first is very helpful

**Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?**

I do. I feel much more comfortable with the key concepts in this PA.

**What was it like working by yourself?**

Good. I was able to do my work more quickly but I also didn't have someone to bounce ideas off of.
